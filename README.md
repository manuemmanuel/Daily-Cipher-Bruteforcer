# HAMSTER COMBAT - Morse Code Brute Force Script

This script attempts to brute force Morse code sequences by sending mouse clicks that represent dots ('.') and dashes ('-') and then asking the user to verify the correct letter. The script uses the `pyautogui` library to simulate mouse clicks and pauses between them to generate the Morse code signals.
